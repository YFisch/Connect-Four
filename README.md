# Connect-Four

## Overview
This repo is for the software implementation of the classic game of Connect Four. This software will allow two players to play against each other or for one player to play against the computer. A description of the game plus the requirements of this implementation are provided below.

## The game
Two players are presented with a 7x6 grid of empty spots. the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into the grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. If all spots are filled and neither player has a winning set, then the game results in a tie.

**The full spec for the game is in the repo...**
